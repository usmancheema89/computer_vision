Tasks performed: 
1. Transform the image in the +x direction by 25%, and create an image
2. Transform the image in the +y direction by 25%, and create an image
3. Rotate the image in Z by 90 degree
4. Rotate the image in Z by -90 degree
5. From the center of the image, in all directions, increase the RGB values of the pixels in a manner that, each pixel from the center, the percentage drops by 1%. 
i.e. the center pixel's RGB will increase by 50%, and the next pixels in x and y directions will be 49%. This goes on and on until the increase becomes 0 %.
6. Please submit the images you have created for each problem and the link to your repo to brian.yu@luxpmsoft.com
