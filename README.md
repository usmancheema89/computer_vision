Hello,

This is Young from LuxPM. You have applied for the position of AI engineer. Thank you for your interest in working with us.

We have reviewed your application and decided to proceed with the next step which is a coding test. Please follow the guideline for the test. 

1. Transform the image in the +x direction by 25%, and create an image
2. Transform the image in the +y direction by 25%, and create an image
3. Rotate the image in Z by 90 degree
4. Rotate the image in Z by -90 degree
5. From the center of the image, in all directions, increase the RGB values of the pixels in a manner that, each pixel from the center, the percentage drops by 1%. 
i.e. the center pixel's RGB will increase by 50%, and the next pixels in x and y directions will be 49%. This goes on and on until the increase becomes 0 %.
